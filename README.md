## How to use

  Depending on the menu that you are in, you will need to write a number to select an option. The number that coresponds with set option will be shown on screen. Sometimes it asks for a name but most of the times it's a number. 
  You can exit the program either by selecting the Exit option in the main menu or by completing the check out menu.
